# BiostatsFall2021
A file where my colleague and I used to do visualization and statistical testing
The aim of the project is to visualize, do statistical test (correlation, anova, & 2 groups t-test), and a regression using cholesterol level, cholesterol ratio, age, and bodyframe to predict diabetes level among female participants.
I would suggest to go to download the html file and look for the result.
Still learning on how to use GitHub
